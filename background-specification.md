# Project Specification
This project involves writing a miniature relational database management system (DBMS) thatstores tables of data, where a table consists of some number of labeled columns of information. Our system will include a very simplequery language for extracting information from these tables. For the purposes of this project, we will deal only with very smalldatabases, and therefore will not consider speed and efficiency at all.
