# CSC3170 Course Project

## Project Overall Description

This is our implementation for the course project of CSC3170, 2022 Fall, CUHK(SZ). For details of the project, you can refer to [project-description.md](project-description.md). In this project, we will utilize what we learned in the lectures and tutorials in the course, and implement either one of the following major jobs:

## Project Specification

<!-- You should remove the terms/sentence that is not necessary considering your option/branch/difficulty choice -->

After thorough discussion, our team made the choice and the specification information is listed below:

- Our option choice is: **Option 3**


## Project Abstract
This project involves writing a miniature relational database management system (DBMS) thatstores tables of data, where a table consists of some number of labeled columns of information. Our system will include a very simplequery language for extracting information from these tables. For the purposes of this project, we will deal only with very smalldatabases, and therefore will not consider speed and efficiency at all.

### Optional/Additional Work    

To make your work attractive, you may think about interesting things to do by yourself. Here are some examples:   
Python-based Implementation: Although Python is not a static language, it's a strongly typed language, which makes it possibleto transfer from those Java codes to Python ones. You may use the typing library for type hinting (but remember to switch the Pythonversion that is compatible to the version you are using when you are visiting this typing api webpage).     
Application with Your Implementation: You may write some small-scale application with the DBMS you just implemented. Forexample, you can try to "reimplement" those work in Assignment 2 -- there would be some expression in your queries that needed tobe changed, as your DBMS is not "as powerful as MySQL", but it's okay as long as you'd make it work.
