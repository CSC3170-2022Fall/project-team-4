## Project Specification

<!-- You should remove the terms/sentence that is not necessary considering your option/branch/difficulty choice -->

After thorough discussion, our team made the choice and the specification information is listed below:

- Our option choice is: **Option 3**

## Abstract
For this project we will create a simple Database Management System in Java. The basic structure of our database system is to store tables, each table having their own rows of data and predetermined columns. The basic functionalities of our database system would be to create a table, load a table from a file, store data into a table, insert a new row into a table, print a table, to select certain data from specific tables. 

We will use the skeleton file provided by UCB, and would have 5 classes we need to complete, which are the CommandIntrepeter, Database, Table, Row, and Condition. Other classes such as the tokenizer class which is used to read the inpupt for the database has already been given in the skeleton file provided by UCB. Our main strategy is to work our way up, starting from the most specific classes before finally integrating them all in the CommandIntrepeter class. Our order would be to impelemtn most functions for the classes row, table, database, commandintrepter, and finally work on the condition class for complex select funtionality. Generally we will follow the suggested order given in the pdf file from UCB. While working on the classes and functionality of the database we would also write test cases for easier debugging and to ensure the program is working as intended.

Once the simple database is completed and fully functional, we would redo assignment 2 using our simple database instead of SQL. (Excluding some queries that requires more complex functionalities not avaiable in our simple database system)
